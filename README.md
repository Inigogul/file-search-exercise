# file-search-exercise
Exercise for Scripting With Python and SQL course from Duke University week 2

## Specific instructions for the project

# In this project, the goal is for you to create a Python script in a single file that will traverse the filesystem finding the largest files in a path.

You will use the following 
Jupyter Notebook
 that has examples on how to walk the filesystem, and this 
Jupyter Notebook
 that captures size information from files.

Your Tasks

Create a new Github repository with a README and a single python file.
Make your Python script accept an argument to traverse any path (don't hardcode the path!)
Use different options in the script for reporting, like:
No more than 20 files
Files larger  than a specific size in megabytes
Complete the Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.
Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.
Bonus

Try adding options to your script like a help menu, or matching specific names or suffixes. For example finding files that end in .mp3
